    <p>Organise your inventory to make the most use of the navigation functionality offered by the triggers (L2/R2). For armour, have the full giant set at the top of your inventory so you can swap to max physical defence from any set using the left trigger (L2), have a similar setup for light armour.</p>
    <p>For weapons, I have have Gold Tracer accessable from Chaos Blade using L2, I have shotel accessable in the same way from Estoc, Murakumo->Pike, Claymore->Lifehunt Scythe</p>
