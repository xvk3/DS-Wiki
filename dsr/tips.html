    <h1>Inventory Tips</h1>

    <p>Organise your inventory to make the most use of the navigation functionality offered by the triggers (L2/R2). For armour, have the full giant set at the top of your inventory so you can swap to max physical defence from any set using the left trigger (L2), have a similar setup for light armour.</p>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Setup</th><th>Chest Slot</th><th>Hand Slot</th><th>Leg Slot</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Max Physical Defence</td><td>Giant Armour</td><td>Giant Guantlets</td><td>Giant Leggings</td><td>Can be swapped to when taking physical critical damage (hornet backstab or riposte)</tr>
    <tr><td>Fast Roll 33p</td><td>Knight Armour</td><td>Elite Knight Gauntlets</td><td>Hollow Soldier Waistcloth</td><td>7.0 free weight (sls + cb + dagger / 3weight shield + estoc + dagger)</td></tr>

    </table>

    <p>I can swap from the Midkumo setup, which uses Murakumo, Dagger and a 3 weight shield, to the Max Magic Defence gear and be under 25% equip load. This is a good swap for MLGS or WoG matchups.</p>
    <p>From Fast Roll 33p to Max Physical Defence / Max Magic Defence during criticals</p>

    <h1>PvP Proficieny</h1>
     <p>When engaging with an player in PvP you should figure out the following</p>
     <ul>
      <li>How much poise your opponent has, and consequently how many attack it takes to stagger them etc</li>
      <li>What utilities do they have? Magic? Pyromancy? 14 Dex? 16 Str? Miracles?</li>
      <li>What is their ring setup? Are they HavelFap? Dual ring? FaP + Hornet? etc</li>
      <li>How much latency do you have with your opponent?</li>
      <li>Do they exhibit any patterns or weaknesses? Constant reverse rolls? Heavy locked strafing? Not holding block? Poor stamina management?</li>
      <li>Can they counterswap faster than you?</li>
      <li>Can they toggle escape</li>
     </ul>
    <h1>Mindgames</h1>
    <h1>Backstabs</h1>
      <p>My main problem with backstabs was that I was afraid to commit to the unlocked backstab. If my opponent and I were strafing I had the tendency to roll away. Once you overcome this barrier your BS defence and offence improve.</p>
      <p>Learn which BS options to use in the different situations is key</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Backstab Option</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Parry Backstab</td><td>Pros</td><td>Cons</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Kick Option Select</td><td>Pros</td><td>Cons</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Stance Cancel Option Select</td><td>Pros</td><td>Cons</td></tr>
      </table>
    <h1>Parries</h1>
    <h1>PvP Hotspots</h1>
    
    <p>The majority of meta level (120-135) PvP occurs in Oolacile Township, however, the Undead Burg and Darkroot are visited infrequently.</p>
    <p>If you're not big into cheating (NoDead / Undead) then arena is a fun and quick way to get PvP with a friend.</p>
